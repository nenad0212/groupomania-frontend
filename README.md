# Groupomania Social Media Site
Groupomania is a social media app, where users can create an account, publish written and multimedia content in a public forum, and like and comment on posts. 


## To use the site
This project is divided between two repositories- one for the frontend, and one for the backend. You will have to clone both to use the site.

1. Clone this (frontend) repository

2. Clone the backend repository from [https://github.com/basiltime/groupomania-server](here), then run `nodemon server` from the project root.

3. Run `yarn start` from the frontend's root directory.
The site should automatically launch. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3006.
